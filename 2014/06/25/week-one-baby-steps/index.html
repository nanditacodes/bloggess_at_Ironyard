<h1 class='post-title'>Week one - Begin with the end in mind.</h1>
<section class='post-content'><p>The day was finally here. My first day at the IronYard. I had decided a few weeks
ago to step out of my comfort zone and begin a 12 week period of learning. I sat in
class super excited to meet my cohort - I would be continuing this journey with them
for the  next 12 weeks. We started the day with getting to know each other a little bit and
setting up the environment. The following days were filled with homework, lots of learning
and ended with a weekend assignment that would exercise our ruby muscles. I have to travel more
than 70 miles every day to class and back. But I don&rsquo;t feel the stress; all I feel is the
adrenaline rush from learning something new and from extrapolating to see how I would turn
out in 12 weeks. This journey is about the climb uphill. It is about putting myself out there
and learning something new; something tells me that I won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>

<section class='post-content'><p>Week 4 and 5 have been about getting upto speed on rails. It has been very
interesting as well as challenging. Seems like I am getting a hang of the concept.
I feel like with more practice I will get better. I really enjoyed creating a twitter-like
app. I called it &ldquo;Jabber&rdquo; which basically means to talk rapidly. I must admit I felt
an initial resistance to this app. The name &ldquo;twitter-like&rdquo; seemed very daunting.
But as I started to work on it, I really started enjoying it. I still struggle with
HTML and CSS part. I know what I want my UI to look like but am having trouble
implementing it. Small stuff like alignment, margins, element positions seem to get me
all the time. This part needs work.</p>
